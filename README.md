LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

*It takes in an action request and an optional argument,
such as a movie-title, both using node's process.argv.

*Action requests include retrieving song information from Spotify API, movie information from OMDB and concert info from the Bands in Town API. Below are LIRI's action requests:

*"concert-this"
*"movie-this"

*LIRI also calls out to a random text file that can include any action or argument. *LIRI'S action request for text file content is:
*"do-what-it-says"

*LIRI uses the npm node module, moment, and dotenv for real-time data and privacy.
